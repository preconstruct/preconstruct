# Adding a second entrypoint

When adding a second entrypoint, you are creating a second place where a package can be accessed from. Note that much of the time you do not need a second entrypoint. We have a guide on [when to use multiple entrypoints](/guides/when-should-i-use-multiple-entrypoints).

So, let's assume we have a package called `emoji-uid` that gets us three random emojis, but we want to make a second function that only uses the best emojis. What we want to be able to do is write is:

```js
import getEmojiId from "emoji-uid";
import getAwesomeId from "emoji-uid/awesome";
```

With `preconstruct`'s base setup, this isn't possible, so we will need to add a new `awesome` entrypoint.

First, our project structure looks like:

```
- src
    /index.js
- package.json
```

and our package.json looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "emoji-uid",
  "version": "1.0.2",
  "description": "Get 🔥 UIDs to help make things 💯",
  "main": "dist/emoji-uid/.cjs.js",
  "preconstruct": {
    "source": "src/index.js"
  }
}
```

Let's assume we've written our new function and written it to `src/awesomenewFunction.js`

The first bit of config we need to do is to add an `entrypoints` field to our preconstruct config. We should modify this in our package.json to read:

```json
  "preconstruct": {
    "source": "src/index.js"
    "entrypoints": [".", "awesome"]
  },
```

This tells preconstruct to look for these two entrypoints. We have written out two, as the first is preconstruct's default entrypoint which we still want to include.

Next, we will want to do to add the location the entrypoint resolves to. We are going to add a new directory with its own `package.json` that represents this. We can run:

```bash
mkdir awesome
touch awesome/package.json
```

After all this, our project should look like:

```
- src
    /index.js
    /awesomeNewFunction.js
- package.json
- awesome
    /package.json
```

The next thing we need to do is tell the new `awesome` entrypoint where to find the source file that it should be bundling from. If we open it up, we want to make it look like:

```json
{
  "main": "dist/emoji-uid.cjs.js",
  "preconstruct": {
    "source": "../src/awesomeNewFunction"
  }
}
```

This tells this entrypoint where to find the source code it should bundle to here.

Finally, run

```bash
yarn preconstruct dev
```

to get set up for development. Preconstruct's CLI will alert you to any problems you are still encountering and provide guides on how to resolve them.

## Got stuck?

For further documentation, we recommend reading:

- [the package configuration options](/config/packages)
- [the entrypoint package.json configuration options](/config/entrypoints)

### I don't have a `preconstruct` field in my package.json

That's fine! If you haven't needed to add this field yet, you can add it with just add the precontsruct field so your `package.json` looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "emoji-uid",
  "version": "1.0.2",
  "description": "Get 🔥 UIDs to help make things 💯",
  "main": "dist/emoji-uid/.cjs.js",
  "preconstruct": {
    "entrypoints": [".", "awesome"]
  },
  "files": ["dist"]
}
```
