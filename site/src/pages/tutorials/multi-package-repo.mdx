# Building a Multi-package Repo

> **Note:** this tutorial builds upon knowledge in [the Getting Started tutorial](/tutorials) so if you haven't gone through it, you should do that first.

We're going to setup a multi-package repo that uses preconstruct to build its packages. We're also going to use [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) for linking and [Changesets](https://github.com/Noviny/changesets) for versioning, these tools aren't required to use preconstruct in a multi-package repo but they work really well together with preconstruct.

We have our `a-random-number` package from the [the Getting Started guide](/getting-started) which is awesome but we want to create a new set of packages with some other numbers, `the-number-one` and `the-number-two`. We're going to use a multi-package repo to manage it because we want to be able to manage all our packages together.

## Setting up Yarn Workspaces

Before we can use preconstruct, we need to setup Yarn Workspaces and create our packages.

To setup Yarn workspaces, we're going to create a new directory and make a `package.json` that looks like this.

```json
{
  "name": "not-random-numbers",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
}
```

We're also going to create our first two packages.

So we need to create a `packages/the-number-one` directory and `packages/the-number-one` directory.

Now we can run `yarn init` in both of the package directories and answer yes to all the questions.

We'll also need to create our source files.

`packages/the-number-one/src/index.js`

```jsx
export default 1;
```

`packages/the-number-two/src/index.js`

```jsx
export default 2;
```

## Setting up preconstruct to build all our packages

Now that we have Yarn workspaces and our packages setup, we can install and setup preconstruct.

```bash
yarn add preconstruct
```

```bash
yarn preconstruct init
🎁 ? not-random-numbers what packages should preconstruct build? packages/*
🎁 ? preconstruct is going to change the main field in your package.json, are you okay with that? (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)the-number-one, the-number-two
🎁 ? would you like to generate module builds? this will write to the module field in your package.json (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection)the-number-one, the-number-two
🎁 success initialised project!
```

preconstruct has asked us some slightly different questions since it's detected that we're in a multi-package repo. We're going to explain exactly what all these questions mean in the future but for now, answering yes to everything will work fine (TODO: write things explaining that stuff)

### Setting up `preconstruct dev`

`preconstruct dev` is a command in preconstruct that lets you import your packages without having to build them every time you make a change or alias the dist files to source files in another tool like webpack, see the [Using preconstruct dev in a multi-package repo guide](/guides/using-preconstruct-dev-in-a-multi-package-repo) for more info.

We're going to add it to a postinstall script so that yarn will run it after packages are installed. Our package.json will now look like this.

```json
{
  "name": "not-random-numbers",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  "dependencies": {
    "preconstruct": "^0.0.70"
  },
  "preconstruct": {
    "packages": ["packages/*"]
  },
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "preconstruct dev"
  }
}
```

### Adding Babel

We'll also want to add Babel so that we can use modern features when writing our code but consumers don't have problems using it like the building your first package tutorial.

We're going to install `@babel/core` and `@babel/preset-env` and add it our Babel config.

```bash
yarn add @babel/preset-env
```

`babel.config.js`

```jsx
module.exports = {
  presets: ["@babel/preset-env"]
};
```

> Curious about why we're going a babel.config.js file here instead of a .babelrc file? Read the [Configuring Babel guide](/guides/configuring-babel)

Now we can run `preconstruct build` to build our packages. 🎉

## Setting up Changesets to version our packages

[Changesets](https://github.com/Noviny/changesets) is an awesome tool for managing versioning and changelogs with a focus on multi-package repos which makes it a great fit for our project. It lets people add "changesets" which declare an intent to release certain packages and then the tool can consume all the changesets to update the versions of packages and changelogs and publish the packages to npm.

We need to install and initialise Changesets.

```bash
yarn add @changesets/cli
```

```bash
yarn changeset init
```

Now we're going to add a couple of scripts to our root package.json so it'll look like this.

```json
{
  "name": "not-random-numbers",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": ["packages/*"],
  "dependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.4.5",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.4.5",
    "@changesets/cli": "^1.1.3",
    "preconstruct": "^0.0.70"
  },
  "preconstruct": {
    "packages": ["packages/*"]
  },
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "preconstruct dev",
    "changeset": "changeset",
    "bump": "changeset bump",
    "release": "preconstruct build && changeset release"
  }
}
```

Let's go through what all these scripts do:

### `yarn changeset`

This is what contributors can run to create a changeset describing what changes they've made.

### `yarn bump`

This is what bumps all of the package versions and changelogs.

### `yarn release`

This is what you can run to release all of the packages to npm.
